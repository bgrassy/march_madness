    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every spring, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a website focused on data science competitions, runs a \"March Machine Learning Madness\" contest. As is implied by the title, the aim of the contest is to make the best prediction of the results of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. This last year was my first attempt at the competition; unfortunately, due to an error in my program that was left unnoticed, I did not do as well as I had hoped. I was hoping to write this up a long time ago, however, I was unable to due to various school and work commitments. This first part focuses on the advanced metrics and statistics that I used to make my predictions, as well as the initial steps of consolidating and parsing the data.\n",

    "Our final measure of overall team performance will be an ELO rating system, similar to the one used in competitive chess. The basic structure of the ratings are simple: the higher the rating, the better. In addition, the predicted win expectancy depends on the difference between the ELOs of the two teams. After each game, the ELO ratings are updated, with the winner's rating increasing by a certain amount and the loser's decreasing by that same amount, which is higher based on the difference between the initial ratings. In addition, the formula also contains a constant known as the \"K-Factor\", which controls how responsive the ratings are to wins and losses. From [this][elo] website, I took the K-factor to be equal to 20, which is the optimal number for the NBA. From this, I defined the ELO rating calculation function to be:\n",

Now, we have two other cases: there exists elo data for the previous game, or it is the first game of the new season and data exists for the season before. If there exists data for the current season, we can just take this for our initial value in our elo calculation. This needs to be tweaked if it is the start of a new season; as a result, I will scale the data in a way that keeps the data centered roughly around 1500, while still relying partially on the performance of the previous season. We thus need to write an accessor method for this. First, recall that at the start of our program we defined a \"team_elos\" dictionary; we will use this to store all of our values. "
